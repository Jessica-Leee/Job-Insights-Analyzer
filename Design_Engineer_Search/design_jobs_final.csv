Atomic Machines is ushering in a new era in micromanufacturing with its Matter Compiler (MC) technology. The MC enables new classes of micromachines to be designed and built by offering manufacturing processes and a materials library that is inaccessible to semiconductor manufacturing methods. The MC promises to unlock MEMS manufacturing both for the many device classes that never could be made by semiconductor methods but also to open up entirely new classes. Furthermore, the MC is fully digital in the way 3D printing is digital, but where 3D printing produces parts of a single material using a single process, the MC is a multi-process, multi-material technology: bits and raw materials go in and complete, functional micromachines come out. The Atomic Machines team has also created an exciting first device – one that was only made possible by the existence of the Matter Compiler – that we will be unveiling to the world soon.

.
About the role:
We are seeking a highly skilled Robotics Mechanical Design Engineer to shape the foundation of our groundbreaking robotic manufacturing platform. In this role, you will work at the cutting edge of precision manipulation, designing critical subsystems that enable the assembly of microscopic parts with unparalleled accuracy.

This is an opportunity to work closely with cross-functional teams early in the product development cycle, collaborating with experts in mechanical design, electrical engineering, vision systems, robotics controls, and manufacturing engineering. You will be part of a fast-paced, hands-on environment, gaining deep multidisciplinary experience while directly influencing the future of scalable, high-precision automation.

If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of robotics and eager to have a high-impact role in an early-stage startup, we’d love to hear from you!

What you’ll do:
Design and develop mechanisms, end effectors, robotic axes, and systems that fit into a modular, complex robotic manufacturing platform.
Subject designs and prototypes to rigorous testing that verifies performance down to the sub-micron level at statistically significant levels.
Work cross-functionally on complex sub-systems of our automated fabrication platform to develop control algorithms, machine vision approaches, and closed-loop inspection and metrology functionalities.
Create CAD models of parts and assemblies, BOMs (bill of materials), detailed drawings, and technical design documentation.
Work collaboratively using PDM and PLM systems, project management tools, and G-Suite tools.
Get hands-on with your designs, driving your work to completion with fabrication and assembly efforts leveraging our in-house lab and machine shop.

What you’ll need:
7–10 years of relevant industry experience, including the design of electromechanical axes (bearing selection, actuator specification, and encoder selection).
Expertise in mechanical design principles, engineering fundamentals, and significant experience with CAD tools for detailed drafting and modeling.
Experience with precision engineering fundamentals.
Self-guided learner with the ability to rapidly ascend learning curves with minimal direction. While the HW Platform team includes highly experienced engineers, success in this role requires curiosity, initiative, and adaptability.
Receptive to feedback from multiple sources and able to quickly adjust approach based on input. The ideal candidate actively seeks feedback—both from colleagues and hands-on experimentation.
Team-oriented mindset with a focus on collective success. Willingness to take on varied tasks, including less glamorous but necessary work, to drive the team forward.
Maker mentality – A strong hands-on background in fabrication, machining, and prototyping is highly valued. While CAM and CNC machining proficiency are preferred, an intuitive understanding of materials and manufacturing processes is essential.
Strong written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to clearly convey complex technical ideas and document designs effectively.
Proactive and self-driven – A self-starter who takes initiative and follows through to completion.
Minimum B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (or equivalent experience).

Bonus points for:
Experience with high vacuum systems, airlocks and load locks.
Experience with laser and optical systems.
