# Data Collection and Methodology

## Data Collection Process

The data for this analysis comes from job postings in the semiconductor industry. The dataset includes information such as job titles, company names, locations, and detailed job descriptions. The data collection process involved:

1. **Data Source**: The data was collected from job postings on various job boards and company websites. The CSV file contains job listings specific to the semiconductor industry.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removal of unnecessary columns (job_type and scrape_date)
   - Handling of missing values in critical fields
   - Fixing duplicated job titles
   - Creation of a standardized date format for temporal analysis

3. **Data Preprocessing for Text Analysis**:
   - Tokenization of job descriptions
   - Removal of stopwords and common job posting language
   - Lemmatization to reduce words to their root form
   - Special handling for multi-word technical terms

## Methodology for Identifying Technical Skills

We employed several advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights from the job descriptions:

### 1. Skill Extraction

- **Domain-Specific Dictionary**: We created a comprehensive dictionary of technical skills relevant to the semiconductor industry, organized by categories.
- **Phrase Detection**: Our analysis prioritizes multi-word technical phrases (e.g., 'mixed signal design', 'rtl verification') over single words to capture more meaningful technical skills.
- **Context-Aware Processing**: The extraction algorithm considers the context in which terms appear, reducing false positives from non-technical mentions.

### 2. Topic Modeling

- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: An unsupervised learning method that discovers abstract 'topics' in a collection of documents. LDA identifies word clusters that frequently appear together, revealing skill groups that are conceptually related.
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: A matrix factorization method that identifies latent features in the data. NMF is particularly effective at extracting sparse, interpretable features, making it ideal for identifying emerging skill clusters.

### 3. N-gram Analysis

- **Bi-gram and Tri-gram Analysis**: We analyze phrases of 2-3 consecutive words to capture compound technical terms that would lose meaning if separated.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transform the job descriptions into numerical feature vectors that emphasize important terms and de-emphasize common words, with special attention to technical n-grams.

### 4. Clustering and Classification

- **K-means Clustering**: Groups similar job descriptions together, allowing us to identify common skill requirements within job clusters.
- **Skill Categorization**: Skills are organized into functional categories (e.g., Digital Design, Analog Design, Verification) to provide structured insights.

### 5. Multi-dimensional Analysis

- **Temporal Analysis**: Job postings are grouped by posting date to identify trends in skill requirements over time.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Skills are analyzed by location to identify regional variations in technical requirements.
- **Role-based Analysis**: Skills are analyzed by job title to understand role-specific technical needs.

### 6. Co-occurrence Analysis

- **Skill Co-occurrence Matrix**: We analyze which skills frequently appear together in job postings, revealing complementary skill sets and emerging skill combinations.

## Advantages of Our Approach

- **Industry-Specific Focus**: Our methodology is tailored specifically to the semiconductor industry's technical vocabulary.
- **Phrase-based Analysis**: By focusing on multi-word technical phrases, we capture more meaningful skills than single-word approaches.
- **Multi-method Validation**: The combination of different analytical methods helps confirm true technical skill patterns versus noise.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Our approach distinguishes between generic terms and their technical usage in semiconductor contexts.
