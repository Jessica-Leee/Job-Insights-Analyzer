Your Team, Your Impact

As an Analog Layout Engineer with Marvell, you’ll be a member of the Central Engineering business group. If you picture Marvell as a wheel, Central Engineering is the center hub providing IP to be used by all the other spokes on that wheel, including Automotive, Storage, Security, and Networking. You’ll be part of a small analog team making a big impact on this organization. Additionally, Marvell has the perfect size and scale for you to learn several aspects of engineering that will be new to you, but also have the time and freedom to dive deep into the details of your specialization on most projects.

What You Can Expect

You will be working with global teams in Argentina, Singapore, the U.S., and throughout Europe. You’ll receive a schematic from an Analog IC Designer. You will then take that schematic and use a CAD tool to graphically design the layers of that schematic. Then, you run simulations and verifications on the design using Cadence Virtuoso, refine and debug as needed in concert with the designer, and both of you keep iterating the design until it meets the desired specifications.

Each project can last from a couple months to a year and a half. You will likely work on just one project in that time, but may be asked to switch to something else if priorities change. Your flexibility is appreciated.

You’ll meet every few days with the designer you’re paired with to share information and work together. No circuits get built or tested here without you both, so your partnership and teamwork is extremely valuable to Marvell. You’ll also have routine meetings with your technical mentor when you have questions, as well as the layout team and the project team where you may have to speak to the entire group and update them about your progress. You may have to present a particular issue or solution you’ve encountered. We are developing brand new cutting-edge technologies here, so we learn new things frequently and share with our colleagues.

What We're Looking For

To be successful in this role, you must:

 Have fundamental understanding of electrical concepts, likely acquired through a degree in Electrical Engineering (graduate or undergraduate).
 Have some specialized course work in analog design or layout, either as part of your Electrical Engineering degree, summer courses, or conference courses.
 Know how to use CAD tools to do the implementation layers, microelectronic layers in design that go beyond the schematics.
 Have excellent communication skills to give status updates to your team, present to global teams in different time zones, and to share information with many different levels of personnel at Marvell. Fluency in English is required.

Additionally, Marvell has the perfect size and scale for you to learn several aspects of engineering that will be new to you, but also have the time and freedom to dive deep into the details of your specialization on most projects.

What You Can Expect

You will be working with global teams in Argentina, Singapore, the U.S., and throughout Europe. You’ll receive a schematic from an Analog IC Designer. You will then take that schematic and use a CAD tool to graphically design the layers of that schematic. Then, you run simulations and verifications on the design using Cadence Virtuoso, refine and debug as needed in concert with the designer, and both of you keep iterating the design until it meets the desired specifications.

Each project can last from a couple months to a year and a half. You will likely work on just one project in that time, but may be asked to switch to something else if priorities change. Your flexibility is appreciated.

You’ll meet every few days with the designer you’re paired with to share information and work together. No circuits get built or tested here without you both, so your partnership and teamwork is extremely valuable to Marvell. You’ll also have routine meetings with your technical mentor when you have questions, as well as the layout team and the project team where you may have to speak to the entire group and update them about your progress. You may have to present a particular issue or solution you’ve encountered. We are developing brand new cutting-edge technologies here, so we learn new things frequently and share with our colleagues.

What We're Looking For

To be successful in this role, you must:

 Have fundamental understanding of electrical concepts, likely acquired through a degree in Electrical Engineering (graduate or undergraduate).
 Have some specialized course work in analog design or layout, either as part of your Electrical Engineering degree, summer courses, or conference courses.
 Know how to use CAD tools to do the implementation layers, microelectronic layers in design that go beyond the schematics.
 Have excellent communication skills to give status updates to your team, present to global teams in different time zones, and to share information with many different levels of personnel at Marvell. Fluency in English is required.

Expected Base Pay Range (USD)

84,910 - 127,200, $ per annum

The successful candidate’s starting base pay will be determined based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, work location and market conditions. The expected base pay range for this role may be modified based on market conditions.

Additional Compensation And Benefit Elements

At Marvell, we offer a total compensation package with a base, bonus and equity.Health and financial wellbeing are part of the package. That means flexible time off, 401k, plus a year-end shutdown, floating holidays, paid time off to volunteer. Have a question about our benefits packages - health or financial? Ask your recruiter during the interview process.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

Any applicant who requires a reasonable accommodation during the selection process should contact Marvell HR Helpdesk at TAOps@marvell.com.
